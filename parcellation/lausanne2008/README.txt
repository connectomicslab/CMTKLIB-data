This multi-resolution parcellation was first used in:

Hagmann P, Cammoun L, Gigandet X, Meuli R, Honey CJ, et al. 2008 Mapping the Structural Core of Human Cerebral Cortex. PLoS Biol 6(7): e159. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0060159 
http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060159

With the release of Freesurfer 5.0, the parcellation was recreated, and includes the insula.
